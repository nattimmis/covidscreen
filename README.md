# Contactless Covid Camera
> Health services and staff around the world are struggling to measure
> a patient's body and head temperature without making some form of
> contact. This project intends to provide a low-cost solution to
> build out a contactless thermal camera using the Melexis MLX90640
> and ESP32 (Wia Dot One in the video) connected over I2C. Data is
> then sent via BLE and captured on a browser using Web Bluetooth.

## Installation & Development setup

On ESP32, connect `pin 21 to SDA` and `pin 22 to SCL`.

To run the device code, the Arduino IDE is required. You can download it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). Once installed, support for ESP32 will need to be added. Steps to do that can be seen [here](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/installing-the-esp32-board-in-arduino-ide-windows-instructions/).

To run the web code, drag `index.html` into a Chrome browser or host on a web server of your choice.
